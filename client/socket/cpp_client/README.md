# C++ Client Usage

If you are using a C++ to communicate with the server, the file you should be most interested in is the `client.cpp` file. The rest of the files are supporting libraries.

Copy these files, and then within the directory, run the following commands to connect to the server.

`make`

`./client (TEAM NAME)` 

If you make any adjustments to this code, you will need to `make clean` before you make again.
